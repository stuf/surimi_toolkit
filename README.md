# Surimi Toolkit

Shorthands to some functions I find myself missing in my day to day Blender work from the comfort of the 3D view (without having to fumblr around in settings panels)

## Features âœ¨

Things available in the sidebar:

- Toggle _Simplify_ and max subdivs
- Change preview and render max samples settings
- Easily change preview render pixel size
- Quickly rename in-game objects weights to match rigify weights names (**Only when meshes are selected**)
- Quick toggle of pose and rest position for armatures (**Only when armatures are selected**)

## Installation

Currently, download `surimi_toolkit.py`, install into Blender by clicking the "Install" button from Blender Addon window.
