# Surimi Toolkit

Shorthands to some functions I find myself missing in my day to day Blender work from the comfort of the 3D view (without having to fumblr around in settings panels)

## Features âœ¨

Things available in the sidebar:

- Toggle _Simplify_ and max subdivs
- Change preview and render max samples settings
- Easily change preview render pixel size
- Quickly rename in-game objects weights to match rigify weights names (**Only when meshes are selected**)
- Quick toggle of pose and rest position for armatures (**Only when armatures are selected**)

## Installation

Download this repository as a ZIP file, install in Blender through the "Install" button in the Blender Addon window.

## Things that need doing

### 3D View

 - [ ] Fix issues with `Knee` and `Elbow` weights
 - [ ] Ability to easily add character-related properties on rigs (like ink color, skin tone, etc)

### Other ???

 - [ ] Make it easier to make a nodegroup or similar that has characer properties for use in nodes (making drivers by hand is boring)

## Acknowledgements

 - Floaty64 for giving tons of valuable feedback
 - ChaoticPan for volunteering to test this out
 - @ranjian0 for the tool of generating Python module stubs to get editor integration in VS Code Intellisense
